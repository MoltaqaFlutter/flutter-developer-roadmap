# OOP Refresh Roadmap (Dart Focused)

Welcome to your OOP refresh roadmap! This guide will help you solidify your programming foundations, learn object-oriented programming concepts in Dart, explore basic design patterns, and practice with hands-on tasks.

## What You Need to Know Before You Start

Before diving into OOP, make sure you understand the following fundamentals:

1. **Variables and Data Types**

   - Basic variables and types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

2. **Conditional Code**

   - Control the program flow using `if / else` statements or `switch`.

3. **Modular Code (Functions / Methods)**

   - Break code into reusable units using functions or methods.

4. **Collections (Lists)**

   - Work with lists and basic data structures to store and organize data.

5. **Iterations (Loops)**

   - Use loops (`for`, `while`) to repeat operations.

6. **Working with Strings**
   - Manipulate and combine strings, use regex when needed.

## OOP Concepts (Skills You Will Acquire)

After completing this section, you should be able to:

1. **Understand Classes and Objects**

   - Define classes and create objects in Dart.
   - Work with instance fields and methods.
   - Use constructors (default, named, and factory).

2. **Apply Encapsulation**

   - Use private members (`_variable`) and getters/setters to protect data.

3. **Implement Inheritance**

   - Use `extends` and `super()` properly.
   - Override methods in subclasses.
   - Understand when to use inheritance versus composition.

4. **Use Polymorphism**

   - Override methods and implement interface polymorphism.
   - Enable dynamic dispatch at runtime.

5. **Work with Abstraction**

   - Create abstract classes and abstract methods.
   - Implement interfaces (`implements`) to enforce behavior.

6. **Utilize Mixins and Composition**

   - Reuse code using `with` keyword.
   - Combine behaviors without deep inheritance.

7. **Implement Basic Design Patterns**
   - Singleton
   - Factory / Abstract Factory
   - Strategy
   - Observer

> After finishing this section, you should be able to design clean OOP code in Dart, apply encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, use mixins effectively, and implement basic design patterns.
